Building a Metaverse Project by Digital++
Release: 0.1
Date: 2023-09-30

About this project
==================
This project is a snapshot of the BUILDING A METAVERSE video series on Youtube, up to and including episode 6 - Avatar Fingers. The project aims to create a free and open-source-ish as possible Vendor Agnostic Multi Player XR Baseline (VAMP-XRB) for any VR/XR developer to use freely to build out their own part of the Metaverse or any VR/XR game or application.

License
=======
All packages and all the services used in this project are subject to their respective licenses. The C# scripts created in the BUILDING A METAVERSE videos as well as the gameobjects manually created and configured in the BUILDING A METAVERSE videos are free of use and you may change and use them at your own discretion.

How to install
==============
Download the complete project, then open it in Unity. Unity will download all packages so that can take a while.
During compilation you may get ERROR MESSAGES regarding m_LeftInputMode and m_RightInputMode. To fix these, go to XR Interaction Hands Setup, XR Origin (XR Rig) in the Hierarchy panel, then in Inspector find the XR Input Modality Manager component, double-click on the XRInputModalityManager script and open it in Visual Studio. Go to line 210 and 211 and make the 2 variables public (may need to do this a few times as the Unity cache system tends to restore the original code from time to time).

Your role...
============
If you find this project useful, please subscribe to the DigitalPlusPlus channel and join the BaM community. Let us know what features and functionalities you'd like to see in our project and if you can, feel free to help building out the project by fixing bugs or adding great new features that everyone can use.
ALSO I AM THINKING OF STARTING A PATREON CHANNEL WHERE PATREONS GET ACCESS TO ALL CODE, ADDITIONAL MATERIALS AND CAN ATTEND REGULAR ONLINE PATREON MEETINGS TO DISCUSS TOPICS AND FOR Q&A.
